1 INTRODUCTION
PancakeSwap launched v3 in 2023, implementing the Concentrated
Liquidity Automated Market Maker (CLAMM) model pioneered
by Uniswap[1]. This iteration of PancakeSwap also incorporated
on-chain liquidity farming within the v3 framework, partially resolving the difficulties of profitable liquidity provisioning by providing token incentives to the in-range liquidity positions. The
CLAMM model revolutionized liquidity provisioning by allowing
liquidity providers to supply assets within specific price ranges,
thereby enhancing capital efficiency and facilitating deeper liquidity for traders. However, this innovation came with its own set of
challenges, including a more complex user experience, increased
impermanent loss, and higher gas costs.
